# Robotic Arm Painter using Arduino Uno ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¨

A 2-DOF robotic arm project developed for Î£Î¦Î—ÎœÎœÎ¥ 16 workshop that combines robotics and art by creating an autonomous painting robot. This project demonstrates fundamental robotics concepts including inverse kinematics, servo control, and serial communication using Arduino.

## Overview

This project was created for the **"Autonomous Robotic Arm Motion: From Theory to Practice"** workshop, presented by the Icarus Project subteam of RAS (Robotics and Automation Society). The goal was to design and implement a robot painter that can receive coordinate data and autonomously draw continuous lines.

## Features

- **2-DOF Robotic Arm Control**: Controls two servo motors to achieve precise positioning
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Calculates joint angles from desired end-effector positions
- **Serial Communication**: Receives drawing coordinates from a Python GUI application
- **Smooth Line Drawing**: Interpolates between waypoints for continuous motion
- **Real-time Control**: Responds to coordinate data in real-time

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO
- 2x Servo Motors
- Robotic arm mechanical structure
- Power supply for servos
- USB cable for Arduino communication

## Software Components

### Arduino Code (`robotic_arm.ino`)
The main Arduino sketch that handles:
- Servo motor control (pins 9 and 10)
- Inverse kinematics calculations
- Serial communication protocol
- Line drawing interpolation

### Python GUI Application
- `painter_app.py`: Source code for the GUI interface

The GUI application allows users to:
- Draw paths by clicking points
- Send coordinate data to the Arduino via serial
- Control the robotic arm's drawing sequence

## Mathematical Foundation

### Inverse Kinematics
The project implements a 2-DOF inverse kinematics solution for a planar robotic arm:

```
Given: Target position (px, py)
Link lengths: l1 = 10, l2 = 9.5

cos(q2) = (pxÂ² + pyÂ² - l1Â² - l2Â²) / (2*l1*l2)
sin(q2) = âˆš(1 - cosÂ²(q2))
q2 = atan2(sin(q2), cos(q2))

d1 = l1 + l2*cos(q2)
d2 = l2*sin(q2)
a = atan2(d2, d1)
q1 = atan2(py, px) - a
```

### Line Interpolation
Smooth line drawing is achieved through linear interpolation between waypoints:
```
For parameter s âˆˆ [0,1]:
px = x_start + s * (x_end - x_start)
py = y_start + s * (y_end - y_start)
```

## Code Structure

### Main Functions

- `Inverse_Kin(float px, float py)`: Calculates and applies inverse kinematics
- `line(float x_start, float y_start, float x_end, float y_end, float u)`: Draws smooth lines between points
- Serial communication protocol for receiving coordinate arrays

### Communication Protocol

The Arduino expects coordinate data in the format:
```
x1,y1\n
x2,y2\n
...
stop\n
```

Each coordinate pair is acknowledged with "ACK" before the drawing sequence begins.

## Project Evolution

The repository contains multiple solution iterations:

1. **Initial Template** (`robotic_arm.ino`): Basic structure with empty function implementations
2. **Solution 1**: Implemented inverse kinematics
3. **Solution 2**: Added line drawing functionality
4. **Solution 3**: Complete implementation with full drawing capabilities

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect servo motors to Arduino pins 9 and 10
   - Assemble the robotic arm mechanism
   - Ensure proper power supply for servos

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Upload `solution3.ino` to Arduino UNO
   - Run `python painter_app.py`
   - Select correct serial port in the GUI

3. **Operation**:
   - Draw desired path in the GUI by clicking points
   - Send coordinates to Arduino
   - Watch the robotic arm execute the drawing

## Technical Specifications

- **Workspace**: Determined by link lengths (l1=10cm, l2=9.5cm)
- **Control Frequency**: ~10Hz update rate
- **Communication**: 9600 baud serial
- **Positioning Accuracy**: Limited by servo resolution (Â±1Â°)
